gitmehj,"Ok THANK YOU. Both of those mainstream astro apps creep me out and I tried and deleted both. As someone who knows how to read birth charts, know what I‚Äôm looking at but other people don‚Äôt, which is simultaneously why I see the appeal and also why people might feel like it‚Äôs too invasive.",0.7155,Positive
gitnttl,This discourse is all coming from Chris Brennan's [latest video](https://youtu.be/aN0AtSHxN6Q) interviewing the creator of costar.  [This](https://youtu.be/aN0AtSHxN6Q?t=3771) is the part of the video where they talk about the trolling section.,0.0,Neutral
gitvd8s,I don‚Äôt like Costar for the way they have it set up. Especially the chart has a table.  I don‚Äôt like the table chart that they have,0.6124,Positive

giuzdds,"This is so validating! I deleted the app last year because it ALWAYS gave me bad news. Same with Pattern. Every single day I woke up to notifications from both apps telling me how horrible life was going to be for me. And, even though I take those things with a grain of salt, the daily doom notifications really started to weigh on me. I began questioning my life choices, considering leaving my partner, etc. I feel so much better without them.",-0.6246,Negative

gitz9d0,"I feel like the pattern does the same thing, I used to use it along with my friend and the description, predictions, timings, whatever you want to call it is all so negative, vague, repetitive, and annoying. We both noticed this so we deleted it.

I say don‚Äôt trust any of the apps, none are genuine and they‚Äôre all surface level training wheel stuff. I only use astro future because I like the way their charts are animated lol.",0.4967,Neutral
gitqdis,"maybe i‚Äôll be flamed for this but honestly i think costar‚Äôs fine. it‚Äôs gotten a lot of people who were otherwise uninterested into astrology in a format that‚Äôs easy to consume. face it‚Äî most people aren‚Äôt interested in learning about transits and aspects and nodal returns. people who *are* interested will find other mediums for more advanced astrology. i listened to the podcast being referenced and all the founder said was that they put in sardonic/edgy passages on good days, and what‚Äôs the problem with that? frankly i like the sass. 

costar has helped a lot of people begin to look inwards and examine themselves (myself included). it has good advice and words of wisdom. a friend of mine can‚Äôt afford therapy and says it helps them a lot with getting through the day. imo we shouldn‚Äôt be so prudish when it comes to these things.

edit: as the founder admitted, they have gone too far at times, and they‚Äôve scaled it back. it‚Äôs clear she takes it very seriously.",0.9923,Positive

I use CHANI Nicholas‚Äôs new app - I pay $15 a month and I personally find it really worth it. I like how easily I can pull up and reference my birth chart- all the transits are aligned with my birth chart, plus she does a ‚Äúweekly podcast‚Äù in the app that gives you a run down of the week ahead.

giwx3db,"In my experience, costar is a great app. The interpretation follows astrological symbolism. What‚Äôs the problem?

gix3ge7,"For me, I‚Äôm not so mad at the negative outlook as much as the vague and bizarre descriptions of my transits.

giv0xjb,"Thank you for posting this. It was interesting to hear what she meant by trolling, basically, being cheeky. Which I can respect. However, I do think OP has a point about these apps. I deleted both Co-Star and Pattern last year because they were just delivering bad news to me every day. I think Pattern is WAY more guilty of this but in the end, I found them both doing it and it was impacting my mental health negatively. 

What I see is that this is a good opportunity for these app creators to realize that maybe some of their audience is not interested in negative predictions every time there's a remotely negative transit and to build in some kind of functionality to omit the bad news from users if they so choose. Even a sliding scale feature would be great so that you're notified if there are some pretty serious negative transits showing up but otherwise, just give the positive aspects attention every day.",0.9829,Positive
giustcy,"Thanks for sharing. Seems they use the term ‚Äútrolling‚Äù almost ironically. OP has been posting about this all over Reddit astrology forums and I‚Äôm starting to think it‚Äôs a personal vendetta more than an actual issue.

Edit. I take that back. It‚Äôs only on two subs. Someone else posted it somewhere else.",0.6908,Positive

gix2pdn,"Time Passages is the only astrology app I keep on my phone now. I have cross referenced it‚Äôs information with several astrology books in my library including Planets in Transit by Robert Hand, and have found everything adds up. The design isn‚Äôt the prettiest but at least the info is legit.",0.5346,Positive
gix7x6w,"Time Passages is my favorite. The interpretations themselves are a bit lazy at times, you'll notice for example they'll re-use the same interp for multiple saturn-sun transits regardless of whether it is a square or a trine for example. So I usually rely on a different website for good interpretations, however the dates they provide and how specific they get with the exact dates is my favorite feature.",0.7506,Positive
giu5ffg,"The Pattern is great and completely accurate, IMO. I just wish they would tell you which transits you're going through. They try to act too mysterious when we all know they use astrology.",0.7783,Positive
giur5by,"I can‚Äôt stand the pattern. I‚Äôd be having a great day and they send some dreadful notification asking a really un relatable question. It‚Äôs like a wet blanket. 

After reading this thread about co star, I feel the same way about pattern. I deleted it a long time ago. You can get your transits from the time nomad app and just google the transit and use your own interpretation of your life atm and get guidance from within. 

Fuck these weird readings from these weird apps.",-0.296,Neutral
gitpas7,"I think it works like most astrology apps, the thing is it sends you ""edgy"" push notifications when important/stressful transits are happening in your chart. They can be pretty funny and weird but they can also be upsetting which some folks have mentioned.",-0.1779,Neutral
giva3kh,it also inacurately compares your chart to ppl who you connect with's. Like it compares your Mars signs together and moon signs etc and says you aren't compatible in a way that is so wrong,-0.3593,Neutral
giukdx0,"Just... their ""chart""... I started with it and only thought I had like 5 houses because they don‚Äôt show the rest of it.",0.3612,Neutral
gitmwkg,"My understanding is that the app uses data from transits going on in your chart to ‚Äúpredict‚Äù what kinds of days/months you‚Äôre going to have. It also seems like they parse out your personality via paragraphs of descriptor words about your strengths and weaknesses that you could otherwise learn about via actually learning how to read your chart/why you are a certain way you are (eg You have a 4h Mars in Aries so at home you‚Äôre driven and determined but may also need a super active lifestyle in order to feel fulfilled, leading you to become bored easily). So basically it takes away the users ability to actually learn about the chart and I also just kinda find the whole thing creepy because they know things about you but won‚Äôt tell you why.

Edited to add: I was thinking about The Pattern but I believe both apps work in a similar way.",0.9517,Positive
giuuze9,"Same!! And I got the expansion awhile back just so I could stash a shit-ton of birth charts and be able to read anyone‚Äôs placements at a moment‚Äôs notice in a format that is legible, colorful, and entertaining",0.5399,Positive
giurafb,Agreed.,0.2732,Neutral
gitrfv4,"More power to you if you enjoy using it or it works for you.

giu86yv,"i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs responsible to use that sort of ‚Äúsass‚Äù when talking about stuff like astrology to people who don‚Äôt know any better and can be seriously influenced by needlessly negative or anxiety-inducing messages. they are putting their trust in the creator of the app, however silly that sounds ... it‚Äôs not cool to use that trust to mess with people when they think you‚Äôre telling them something that‚Äôs written in the stars.",0.6745,Positive

gix9qjo,"If it works for you then that's great. The biggest problems people seem to have are incorrect placements, vague descriptions of aspects/transits as well as weird predictions, and the negativity. Some people are okay with all of this.

My biggest problem is the way they lay out the chart makes it harder for beginners to get into astrology. I know it looks better but people think ""I don't have a 6th house"" or a certain placement just because how its set up.
