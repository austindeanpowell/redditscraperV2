kurhm6,gitqdis,"maybe i‚Äôll be flamed for this but honestly i think costar‚Äôs fine. it‚Äôs gotten a lot of people who were otherwise uninterested into astrology in a format that‚Äôs easy to consume. face it‚Äî most people aren‚Äôt interested in learning about transits and aspects and nodal returns. people who *are* interested will find other mediums for more advanced astrology. i listened to the podcast being referenced and all the founder said was that they put in sardonic/edgy passages on good days, and what‚Äôs the problem with that? frankly i like the sass. 

costar has helped a lot of people begin to look inwards and examine themselves (myself included). it has good advice and words of wisdom. a friend of mine can‚Äôt afford therapy and says it helps them a lot with getting through the day. imo we shouldn‚Äôt be so prudish when it comes to these things.

kurhm6,giv0xjb,"Thank you for posting this. It was interesting to hear what she meant by trolling, basically, being cheeky. Which I can respect. However, I do think OP has a point about these apps. I deleted both Co-Star and Pattern last year because they were just delivering bad news to me every day. I think Pattern is WAY more guilty of this but in the end, I found them both doing it and it was impacting my mental health negatively. 

What I see is that this is a good opportunity for these app creators to realize that maybe some of their audience is not interested in negative predictions every time there's a remotely negative transit and to build in some kind of functionality to omit the bad news from users if they so choose. Even a sliding scale feature would be great so that you're notified if there are some pretty serious negative transits showing up but otherwise, just give the positive aspects attention every day.",0.9829,Positive
kurhm6,giustcy,"Thanks for sharing. Seems they use the term ‚Äútrolling‚Äù almost ironically. OP has been posting about this all over Reddit astrology forums and I‚Äôm starting to think it‚Äôs a personal vendetta more than an actual issue.

The design isn‚Äôt the prettiest but at least the info is legit.",0.5346,Positive
kurhm6,gix7x6w,"Time Passages is my favorite. The interpretations themselves are a bit lazy at times, you'll notice for example they'll re-use the same interp for multiple saturn-sun transits regardless of whether it is a square or a trine for example. So I usually rely on a different website for good interpretations, however the dates they provide and how specific they get with the exact dates is my favorite feature.",0.7506,Positive

kurhm6,giur5by,"I can‚Äôt stand the pattern. I‚Äôd be having a great day and they send some dreadful notification asking a really un relatable question. It‚Äôs like a wet blanket. 

After reading this thread about co star, I feel the same way about pattern. I deleted it a long time ago. You can get your transits from the time nomad app and just google the transit and use your own interpretation of your life atm and get guidance from within.

kurhm6,giukdx0,"Just... their ""chart""... I started with it and only thought I had like 5 houses because they don‚Äôt show the rest of it.",0.3612,Neutral
kurhm6,gitmwkg,"My understanding is that the app uses data from transits going on in your chart to ‚Äúpredict‚Äù what kinds of days/months you‚Äôre going to have. It also seems like they parse out your personality via paragraphs of descriptor words about your strengths and weaknesses that you could otherwise learn about via actually learning how to read your chart/why you are a certain way you are (eg You have a 4h Mars in Aries so at home you‚Äôre driven and determined but may also need a super active lifestyle in order to feel fulfilled, leading you to become bored easily). So basically it takes away the users ability to actually learn about the chart and I also just kinda find the whole thing creepy because they know things about you but won‚Äôt tell you why.

Edited to add: I was thinking about The Pattern but I believe both apps work in a similar way.",0.9517,Positive

My biggest problem is the way they lay out the chart makes it harder for beginners to get into astrology. I know it looks better but people think ""I don't have a 6th house"" or a certain placement just because how its set up.

k4q7wl,geaj10e,"Hey thanks for doing this AMA! I have a few questions:

1. One of the rumors that is frequently spread about Co-Star was that your team didn't have much experience or background in astrology when you started programming it, or that you didn't rely on more experienced astrologers. Could you clarify to whatever extent this is true or not true? If it was true, is it something you've been working on or changed since you started?
2. I think I saw a poll recently that said that you are considering integrating whole sign houses as an option for house systems. Is this still something that you are considering?  

3. Oh yeah, and do you feel comfortable sharing your birth chart? Curious what transits you were having when you started the app. Did you have a sense that it was going to do as well as it did when you started?",0.9728,Positive

if youre trying strictly to develop a social media app, you‚Äôve done a spectacular job. bravo. anyone who knows anything just barely beneath surface level thinks your app is totally useless.

i think i speak for most everyone when i say that the app needs an option to flip between the wheel and block chart *on your phone*. on its own, the block chart actually tells me as an astrologer nothing. actual nothing. real, practicing astrologers take every detail of a chart into account, signs and house placements dont cut it on their own.

speaking of houses, options to switch between multiple house systems throughout history would be necessary. your rationale for porphyry makes *sense*, but it sucks. if you had really done your research, you would know that alcabitius was considered the standard for natal and regiomontanus for everything else for the entire classical period. there is no way this can be difficult to implement, all of the house systems and their formulas are a google search away.

ive always thought the horoscopic blurbs were great. i like the way you guys approach compatability. i like how personal the app is. the app is far from perfect. my hope is that, instead of defending what you already have like im trying to destroy it, you take into consideration my, and everyone elses, suggestions and work towards a perfect app. i wont be reinstalling it until then.",0.935,Positive

Some context is that we'd been posting in support of BLM for a week ‚Äì [George Floyd's family's gofundme](https://twitter.com/costarastrology/status/1265761940992856065), [FTP](https://twitter.com/costarastrology/status/1266388365966000129), [bail funds](https://twitter.com/costarastrology/status/1266393495260008448), posting [against](https://twitter.com/costarastrology/status/1266079151850749953) people [shitting on the riots](https://twitter.com/costarastrology/status/1266078427741814785),[ ](https://twitter.com/costarastrology/status/1266388365966000129)[etc](https://twitter.com/costarastrology/status/1266541125407473665). We've been posting about the struggles we care about since we made social accounts, on both twitter and ig stories ‚Äì using our platform to amplify issues we care about, using astrology to make difficult conversations more accessible. In this case, we fucked up. We tried to put [protest tips](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9137e3ulpjqqs51/IMG_1618.PNG?dl=0) in a meme format, trying to encourage people to use water instead of milk to wash out people's eyes, [blurring out protestor's faces](https://twitter.com/costarastrology/status/1267171229762453505), and using signal. Most of the team is POC and we'd all been at the NYC protests, so it didn't even occur to us that people would interpret it as making fun or light of the protests. We [apologized](https://www.instagram.com/p/CA_YbfsASuQ/), and I'm sorry.

The second was something like ""Aries disappeared in a manic episode."" We weren't trying to invoke bipolar mania, we were invoking Manic Monday, episodes of hyperactivity without it being correlated to a diagnosis ‚Äì the same way people say ""I'm having a nervous breakdown.""

i would love to hear more about how your family used astrology in everyday life as you mentioned in other comments. was astrology your main form of spirituality? (if you view it that way)",0.9641,Positive

k4q7wl,geanhnd,"1. I‚Äôm not sure about the not crediting or paying for astrologers rumour, but I have definitely heard that there aren‚Äôt *any* astrologers involved and that most content is auto-generated... I‚Äôm inclined to believe it as most of the app reflects this: some natal descriptions are vague or off-base, and the compatibility calculations are completely wrong because they‚Äôre overly simplified. 

2. I don‚Äôt think which house system is as much the problem as the table. The table just shows what planet is where but it‚Äôs difficult to read a chart properly from that. And it doesn‚Äôt show or take into account aspects at all. Astrologers use circular charts for this reason (and this is another reason I would believe that there are no astrologers on the team). Ability to change house systems would be nice, but the main issue is the layout with the table... it‚Äôs pretty but not useful. I‚Äôve seen some Co-Star circular charts, so I assume the functionality does exist? It‚Äôs just not on the app directly.",-0.6251,Negative

A technical astrologer? What does that role really entail in the context of the app? I had a look at the listing out of interest (sadly cannot apply as I‚Äôm not American), but I‚Äôm having trouble seeing how that astrological knowledge would be put into use, why Brady‚Äôs transit grids are important to know when they are not commonly used, or why sketching the geometry of the transits is emphasised as a skill- basic astrology programs do this, and anyone who can read an ephemeris could too.",0.2755,Neutral

You can see circular charts on our website, by casting your chart on [our website](https://www.costarastrology.com/natal-chart/19), or (iOS only) navigate to Settings, turn Public Profile on, and then tap the link.

k4q7wl,geaxg2y,"Oh, I love poetry. But most of the Co-Star descriptions are vague to me and most people, and it is likely to make them think that astrology is vague by nature. Things are open to interpretation, but if I am able to completely relate to descriptions of planets in signs that I don‚Äôt have more than my own, something is missing... And some details are foundationally wrong, like the ascendant being a ‚Äúmask‚Äù, which is not a commonly accepted idea present in modern *or* older branches of astrology I know of except pop astrology. 

A possible solution to that chart situation could be to implement the circular chart within the App itself, and have the table below to make it easier to read and help people connect the dots; people would be able to learn what the circle itself means and read it for themselves- this would be a better learning opportunity than leaving them in the dark about it and needing us as astrologers to constantly explain why we can‚Äôt help with those tables-> Costar becomes a stepping stone to actual astrology rather than something to engage with. Also, one of the most fundamental parts of astrology is not included because of not using circular charts: Aspects. Regardless of system of astrology, these are paramount and easy to explain... and descriptions of these would immediately be more personalised than vague. 

I hope this is not too frank, but ultimately I stopped using Co-Star because in comparison to what I have learned about astrology it either lacked clarity, omits important information or was too basic where it matters, and the content and horoscopes were a little too surface level to be useful. Unfortunately the only strong point it has is a pretty design, and I would have found some of the notifications to be extremely unhelpful if I trusted the app. For example, I was once told to not try to do too much that day. Luckily I can read my own transits and got through a lot that day, but for someone who can‚Äôt do that then it would‚Äôve been extremely demotivating. A few times it would tell me not to trust my friends, and the majority of the time the advice borders on non-sensical-> as if it is *trying* to be poetic but ultimately says very little of substance.",0.995,Positive
